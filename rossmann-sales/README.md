### Time Series with the Rossmann dataset

This project uses the Rossmann store sales dataset for time series analysis. You can read more about the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales. The prediction goal of the competition is to predict the daily sales for Rossmann retail stores, based on variables such as competitor store proximity, discounts, etc.  

## Setup:

There are a couple things you'll need to install to make working with code, getting data etc. easier. Please refer to instructions below.

### Github:

* You'll need a way of getting updates to code from other users and posting your own updates to the project. Gitbash (https://gitforwindows.org/) is a good tool for Windows. For Mac users, you can follow the instructions here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

### Kaggle:

* Sign up for an account at kaggle.com. It's free and you only need an email.  
* Once you have an account, you'll be able to download datasets and upload predictions through the web browser.  
* Another option is to use the kaggle-cli to pull down and upload data to Kaggle.com. Note that it requires Python3 and the `pip` package manager to be installed on your system. Instructions are here: https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api

### Some language for Data Science

* This could be one of: Python, R, SAS, etc. depending on your preference.  
* Python: Recommend Anaconda or Miniconda. These are good because they come with `jupyter`. Here is a link to Miniconda: https://conda.io/miniconda.html   
* R: Recommend using RStudio. You'll need to install both R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
